This is a Ebay Analyzer that hopefully will be able to find currently listed items on Ebay, use machine learning to create a model for the price of the items and identify undervalued items. 
The end goal is to have the analyzer find the items, create models and reports on them, and then issue last second bids on them up to a maximum target prices computed by the model.
